        Visual Studio Code or VS Code is an IDE similar to Brackets and Codepen. You can write codes in many different languages like HTML, JS, CSS, C, C++, C#, PHP, Java, JS React, Python, R, JSON, Ruby, Typescript, Shell Script and many many more. You can add extensions, debug and many more things. You've got an integrated terminal and debug console too. Its also got an amazing feature called Intellisense which gives you suggestions for functions, variables, properties etc as you type, which helps you code faster. VS Code is by far the most commonly used IDE for coding.

        Console: 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 31%; margin-top: -34px; width: 600px;">
        The Console, also known as the Debug Console, is where you can print out something which you don't want to show to the user but instead you want to use that for debugging. Anytime you've got a doubt in the code, you can always console the values in the debug console to see if your code is working or not. That's the purpose of the debug console. Every HTML page has a debug console. Even this page has one. To open it, you have to right click on the page, click on Inspect, and out of the many options you get on the top of the popup, click on Console. This is the debug console. Here you would get all the things that the programmer would have consoled to see if it is working or not. To print something on the console, you have to type <i>console.log("")</i> and inside the double quotes, you can type whatever you want. This should print the text on the console. Or if you wanted to print a number or variable, you can remove the double quotes and type in the number or variable.

      var diff = num1 - num2;
      var product = num1 * num2;
      var quotient = num1 / num2;
      var exponent = Math.pow(num1, num2);
      var squareRoot = Math.sqrt(9);

      console.log(firstName.concat(lastName));
      console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
      console.log("9 + 3 = " + sum);
      console.log("9 - 3 = " + diff);
      console.log("9 x 3 = " + product);
      console.log("9 รท 3 = " + quotient);
      console.log("9 to the power 3 = " + exponent);
      console.log("Square root of 9 = " + squareRoot);
